## Team

Built as a 3-person college project by Anish ([@anishm6204](https://github.com/anishm6204)), Abhinav ([@AbhinavPInamdar](https://github.com/AbhinavPInamdar)), and Anjali.

##  Overview

EchoFS is a research-driven distributed file system that intelligently balances the CAP theorem trade-offs by dynamically switching between strong consistency and eventual consistency based on real-time network conditions. Unlike traditional distributed systems that force users to choose between consistency and availability, EchoFS makes this decision automatically and continuously.

### The Problem

Traditional distributed file systems face a fundamental challenge:
- **Strong Consistency**: Guarantees data correctness but suffers during network issues (high latency, unavailability)
- **Eventual Consistency**: Maintains availability but risks stale reads and conflicts

### Our Solution

EchoFS introduces an **Adaptive Consistency Controller** that:
1. Monitors network conditions in real-time
2. Analyzes partition risk, replication lag, and write patterns
3. Dynamically switches consistency modes without user intervention
4. Achieves **85% latency reduction** during network stress while maintaining data integrity

##  Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Consistency Engine
- **Intelligent Mode Switching**: Automatically transitions between strong (C) and available (A) consistency
- **Policy-Based Decisions**: Weighted scoring system considers multiple factors
- **Hysteresis Mechanism**: Prevents mode flapping with multi-sample confirmation
- **Emergency Mode**: Immediate fallback during severe network partitions

### 2. User Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secure token-based auth with 24-hour expiration
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin users get access to metrics and consistency dashboards
- **User Isolation**: Each user can only access their own files
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt

### 3. Distributed Architecture
- **Master-Worker Design**: Centralized coordination with distributed storage
- **gRPC Communication**: High-performance inter-service communication
- **File Chunking**: 1MB chunks with compression for efficient storage
- **Replication**: Configurable replication factor across workers

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Comprehensive system metrics collection
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Visual monitoring of consistency modes and performance
- **Health Checks**: Continuous worker health monitoring
- **Audit Logging**: Complete trail of consistency decisions

### Data Flow

**File Upload Flow:**
```
1. User uploads file via frontend
2. Master authenticates user (JWT validation)
3. Master chunks file (1MB chunks) and compresses
4. Master queries Consistency Controller for mode
5. Controller analyzes network conditions
6. Based on mode:
   - Strong (C): Quorum write to workers (majority must ack)
   - Available (A): Async write with eventual replication
7. Master stores metadata in PostgreSQL
8. Returns success to user
```

**Consistency Decision Flow:**
```
1. Master requests consistency mode for operation
2. Controller evaluates:
   - Partition Risk (40% weight)
   - Replication Lag (30% weight)
   - Write Rate (20% weight)
   - User Hint (10% weight)
   - Recent Change Penalty (-20%)
3. Score calculation:
   score = 0.4*partition + 0.3*lag + 0.2*writes + 0.1*hint - 0.2*penalty
4. Decision:
   - score > 0.6 → Available mode
   - score < 0.3 → Strong mode
   - else → Hybrid mode
5. Multi-sample confirmation (3 samples over 5 seconds)
6. Mode transition with state persistence
```

##  Adaptive Consistency Controller

### Why We Built It

Traditional distributed systems force a binary choice between consistency and availability. We recognized that network conditions are dynamic, and the optimal choice changes over time. Our controller makes this decision automatically based on real-time conditions.

### Design Decisions

#### 1. **Policy-Based Decision Engine**

**Decision:** Use a weighted scoring system rather than simple thresholds.

**Rationale:**
- Network conditions are multi-dimensional (latency, packet loss, partition risk)
- Single-factor decisions are too simplistic and cause unnecessary mode switches
- Weighted scoring allows fine-tuned control over decision factors
- Easy to adjust weights based on workload characteristics

**Implementation:**
```go
score = 0.4*partitionRisk + 0.3*replicationLag + 
        0.2*writeRate + 0.1*userHint - 0.2*recentChangePenalty
```

**Why these weights?**
- **Partition Risk (40%)**: Most critical factor - network splits require immediate action
- **Replication Lag (30%)**: Indicates system health and sync capability
- **Write Rate (20%)**: High writes benefit from async mode
- **User Hint (10%)**: Allows application-level preferences
- **Recent Change Penalty (-20%)**: Prevents flapping

#### 2. **Hysteresis Mechanism**

**Decision:** Require multiple consecutive samples before mode transition.

**Rationale:**
- Prevents "flapping" (rapid mode switches) which degrades performance
- Network conditions fluctuate; we need sustained change to justify transition
- Reduces unnecessary overhead from mode switching
- Provides stability during transient network issues

**Implementation:**
- Requires 3 consecutive samples agreeing on new mode
- Samples taken 5 seconds apart
- Configurable thresholds per deployment

**Trade-off:** Slower reaction to network changes vs. system stability. We chose stability because:
- Mode switches have overhead (state sync, connection reconfig)
- Most network issues are transient
- 15-second delay is acceptable for consistency mode changes

#### 3. **Persistent State Management**

**Decision:** Use BadgerDB for controller state persistence.

**Rationale:**
- Controller must survive crashes without losing consistency state
- In-memory state would cause data inconsistency after restart
- BadgerDB provides:
  - Embedded key-value store (no external dependencies)
  - ACID transactions
  - Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
  - Fast read/write performance

**Alternative Considered:** Redis
- **Rejected because:** Adds external dependency, network overhead
- **BadgerDB wins:** Embedded, simpler deployment, sufficient performance

#### 4. **Emergency Mode**

**Decision:** Immediate switch to Available mode during severe partitions.

**Rationale:**
- During network partitions, strong consistency becomes impossible
- Waiting for hysteresis would cause unnecessary failures
- Better to serve stale data than no data
- Automatic recovery when partition heals

**Threshold:** Partition risk > 0.8 (80% of workers unreachable)

#### 5. **Operator Overrides**

**Decision:** Allow manual consistency mode override.

**Rationale:**
- Operators may have knowledge the system doesn't (planned maintenance, known issues)
- Critical operations may require guaranteed strong consistency
- Provides escape hatch for unexpected scenarios
- Maintains operator control while automating common cases

**Implementation:**
- Global override affects all objects
- Per-object override for critical data
- Overrides persist across restarts
- Clear API to set/remove overrides

### Controller Architecture

```go
type ConsistencyController struct {
    store          *BadgerStore          // Persistent state
    policyEngine   *PolicyEngine         // Decision logic
    networkMonitor *NetworkMonitor       // Health tracking
    stateManager   *StateManager         // Mode transitions
    overrides      map[string]string     // Manual overrides
    criticalKeys   map[string]bool       // Always-strong keys
}
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Policy Engine**: Implements weighted scoring and decision logic
2. **Network Monitor**: Tracks worker health, latency, partition risk
3. **State Manager**: Handles mode transitions with hysteresis
4. **BadgerStore**: Persists state for crash recovery

### API Endpoints

```
GET  /v1/mode?object_id=<id>     # Get current consistency mode
POST /v1/hint                    # Set consistency hint
POST /v1/override                # Set global override
GET  /v1/critical-keys           # Manage critical keys
GET  /health                     # Health check
GET  /status                     # Controller status
```

##  Design Decisions

### 1. Master-Worker Architecture

**Decision:** Centralized master with distributed workers.

**Rationale:**
- **Simplifies coordination**: Single source of truth for file metadata
- **Easier consistency**: Master coordinates all operations
- **Simpler client**: Clients only talk to master
- **Scalability**: Workers can be added/removed dynamically

**Trade-offs:**
- Master is single point of failure (mitigated with health checks and restart)
- Master can become bottleneck (mitigated with async operations)

**Alternative Considered:** Peer-to-peer architecture
- **Rejected because:** Complex consensus, harder to implement consistency controller

### 2. File Chunking (1MB chunks)

**Decision:** Split files into 1MB chunks before storage.

**Rationale:**
- **Parallel uploads**: Multiple chunks uploaded simultaneously
- **Efficient storage**: Deduplication at chunk level
- **Better distribution**: Chunks spread across workers
- **Partial downloads**: Can fetch specific chunks
- **Network efficiency**: Smaller units handle network issues better

**Why 1MB?**
- Balance between overhead (too small) and granularity (too large)
- Fits well in memory for processing
- Good for network transmission (not too large for retries)
- Industry standard (similar to S3 multipart uploads)

### 3. gRPC for Inter-Service Communication

**Decision:** Use gRPC between master and workers.

**Rationale:**
- **Performance**: Binary protocol, faster than REST/JSON
- **Type safety**: Protocol buffers provide strong typing
- **Streaming**: Supports bidirectional streaming for large files
- **Code generation**: Auto-generates client/server code
- **HTTP/2**: Multiplexing, header compression

**Alternative Considered:** REST API
- **Rejected because:** JSON overhead, no streaming, slower

### 4. PostgreSQL for Metadata

**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL for user and file metadata.

**Rationale:**
- **ACID transactions**: Critical for user data and file ownership
- **Relational model**: Natural fit for users → files relationship
- **Foreign keys**: Automatic cascade deletion
- **Indexing**: Fast queries on owner_id, email
- **Mature ecosystem**: Well-understood, reliable

**Alternative Considered:** DynamoDB
- **Rejected because:** More complex for relational data, eventual consistency

### 5. JWT Authentication

**Decision:** Stateless JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration.

**Rationale:**
- **Stateless**: No session storage needed
- **Scalable**: No shared session state between servers
- **Standard**: Industry-standard authentication
- **Secure**: HMAC-SHA256 signing
- **Self-contained**: Token includes user info (no DB lookup per request)

**Trade-offs:**
- Cannot revoke tokens before expiration (mitigated with short TTL)
- Token size larger than session ID (acceptable for our use case)

### 6. Bcrypt for Password Hashing

**Decision:** Use bcrypt with default cost (10).

**Rationale:**
- **Adaptive**: Cost factor can increase as hardware improves
- **Salted**: Automatic salt generation
- **Slow by design**: Resistant to brute force
- **Industry standard**: Well-tested, secure

**Alternative Considered:** Argon2
- **Rejected because:** Bcrypt sufficient for our needs, more widely supported

### 7. Role-Based Access Control

**Decision:** Simple role system (user/admin) rather than complex permissions.

**Rationale:**
- **Simplicity**: Two roles cover our use cases
- **Easy to understand**: Clear distinction between regular and admin users
- **Sufficient**: Admin needs metrics/consistency, users need files
- **Extensible**: Can add more roles later if needed

**Implementation:**
- Role stored in user table
- Role included in JWT token
- Frontend shows/hides features based on role
- Backend validates role for protected endpoints

### 8. Compression Before Chunking

**Decision:** Compress files before splitting into chunks.

**Rationale:**
- **Better compression ratio**: Compressing whole file vs individual chunks
- **Reduced storage**: Smaller chunks to store
- **Network efficiency**: Less data to transfer
- **Standard practice**: Similar to tar.gz workflow

**Trade-off:** Must decompress entire file for access (acceptable for our use case)

##  Performance Results

### Experimental Validation

We conducted extensive experiments comparing EchoFS's adaptive consistency against fixed strong consistency:

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Normal Operation**: Baseline performance
2. **High Latency Network**: 200ms delay, 10% packet loss
3. **Network Partition**: Worker isolation for 60 seconds
4. **Heavy Write Load**: 100 operations/second

#### Results

| Metric | Fixed Strong | Adaptive | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| P50 Latency (Normal) | 8ms | 8ms | 0%          |
| P95 Latency (Normal) | 45ms | 45ms | 0% |
| P50 Latency (Partition) | 95ms | 15ms | **84%** |
| P95 Latency (Partition) | 380ms | 48ms | **87%** |
| Availability (Partition) | 87.5% | 99.6% | **14%** |
| Stale Reads (Partition) | 0% | 4.6% | Acceptable |
| Convergence Time | N/A | 2.3s avg | - |

**Key Findings:**
- **85% latency reduction** during network stress
- **Zero data loss** during mode transitions
- **99.6% availability** maintained during partitions
- **Automatic conflict resolution** for 75% of conflicts
- **Stable operation** with hysteresis preventing flapping
